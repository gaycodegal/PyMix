# Mix - A Python Utility

Easily make files harder to read for transmission. Not a cryptographic tool, just useful when sending things like zip archives of code to people via email, as Google has now started blocking these kind of archives for security reasons.

*Requires Python 3, written and tested in Python 3.5.2*

Usage: python3 mix.py mix/unmix

Description:
 Mixes a file up non-cryptographically
     so that it can pass cursory checks of filetype.
         1: No bytemask will greatly aid speed, but
	     a bytemask will disguise plaintext for you.
	         2: Currently only works with files that can
		     fit in your computer's ram. Could (and will eventually)
		         be modified to work on any size.

Options:
-b/--bytemask: <xor byte mask 8 bits> #eg 10010100
-o/--dst: <file output path>
-h/--help: #this help
-i/--src: <file input path>
